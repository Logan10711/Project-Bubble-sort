Problem Breakdown and Computational Thinking

Why I chose Bubble Sort

Bubble sort is one of the easiest sorting algorithimns to visualize and explain to someone who may not even be familiar any coding
whatsoever. So I wanted to choose something that would be useful tool to further the knowledge of someone already familiar with the sorting 
algorithim aswell as be able to still explain the basics to someone totally new to it.

How the thinking breaks down:

Decomposition: Separate the task into small steps: compare, swap, repeat until no changes happen.

Pattern Recognition: Each pass pushes the largest value to the end, so the list gets more sorted with every loop.

Abstraction: Focus only on the comparisons and swaps. Ignore anything that doesn’t affect the order.

Algorithm Design: Loop through the list, check neighbors, swap if needed, and stop when a full pass has no swaps.

Steps to Run

first, input a list of numbers seperated by commas 
next click "visualize sort" if you inputed incorrectly, it will wait until the input fits the criteria and output a message saying to fix it 
if you inputed correctly, it will output a visualization of what bubble sort looks like and each step in sorting the array

Author and Acknowledgment

Made by Logan Walter. ChatGPT (level 4) helped me figure out how to set up Gradio for the Space and walked me through adding things like matplotlib.pyplot as plt for the plots and Pillow for handling image processing behind the scenes. All code was written by me and ChatGPT just walked me through how to implement and improve the visuals of my code.
